<h1>👋 Hi! I’m Charlie</h1>

I am a full-stack developer with an educational background in Criminology and Cyber Security. 

I embarked on BrainStation's Software Engineering Bootcamp in September 2023 and have applied my skills working as a freelance software engineer for Home EcoEarner, a start-up company that will provide renewable energy for domestic properties. I have continually developed their website, in designing the layout of pages, integrating a database to collect users' details and configuring DNS settings in deploying the website to the web.   

- ❤️ I enjoy working with JavaScript, React, Next.js, Node.js, MySQL and SASS.

- 🌱 I’m currently learning Tailwind CSS to expand my design skillset.

- 👀 I am curious about learning Jest in the future.
